- 👋 Hi, I’m @Heinz9 (Heinz)
- 👀 I’m fascinated in home-automation and the many ways of connecting smart things (started originally with a CCU and Homematic equipment)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning scripting and visualisations of my equipment using ioBroker
- 💞️ I’m looking to extend my (still basic - but increasing) homeautomation competences...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
